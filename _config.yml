    Some improvements for marketplace Sharetribe
        1. Added JS gallery for products, with images full screen magnification
        2. Added the integration with PayPal (the credentials for the test are sent on request)
        3. DelayedJob is replaced with ActiveJob using Sidekiq
        4. It is configured to use Nginx as the frontend and statics server, and Puma as the backend application server
        5. To store the images using Amazon S3"
